# Soccer-Scores

This app is designed to let the user check on all the games being played on the day. The user is then able to click on either the game or one of the teams for more information on them. Within the team page, one can subsequently click on players for further details on the individual.

Soccer-Scores was built in React, using Redux and the Thunks middleware to handle the async API fetch calls.

The API used for Soccer-Scores is https://sportmonks.com/
